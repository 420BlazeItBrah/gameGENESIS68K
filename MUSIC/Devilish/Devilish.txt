Updates:
1.01 - Whoops, somehow Final Boss got replaced
by a copy of the Intro song. Sorry!

Notes:
Holy shit this game's songs kick ass. Too bad
the game itself is bug-ridden and frustrating
to play... :( If this were slightly better,
it would have been a great Arkanoid clone
with some nice new elements.

Defeat the Boss is for bosses you must beat
to proceed, while Survive the Boss is for
bosses that give challenges in Stage 2, 4,
and 6.

Time's Running Out repeats endlessly - to get
it to a loop point is when the notes are so
high it no longer plays some, and this would
take about 23 minutes. Instead, I simply have
it play for 2:45 and apruptly stop it there.
That's longer then it would be ingame,
anyway. :p

Hitoshi Sakimoto has gone on to greater
projects - I hear he's scoring Final Fantasy
XII. Hmm...

I must ponder.
